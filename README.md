# ttn

An unofficial LaTeX style file for “technical notes.”

### Installation notes

After cloning this repository, create `$HOME/texmf/tex/latex/ttn` (on Linux) or
`$HOME/Library/texmf/tex/latex/ttn` (MacOS) and make a symbolic link
there to the file `ttn.sty`. Then run `texhash`.

After this, you can use `\usepackage{ttn}` in your LaTeX file.

Expect breaking changes.
